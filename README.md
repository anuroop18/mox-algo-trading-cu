# What do we want to do?

1. Deposit into Aave
2. Withdraw from Aave
3. Trade tokens through Uniswap
4. Redeposit into Aave

Aave (our bank account) => Interest yield

We are going to be passive investment managers.
We decide we want to do 70% ETH, 30% USDC => deposit into Aave => Make out percentage yield.
Every couple of months, we balance the portfolio so that we are still at 70 30 target.
We pull money out of aave => do swapping => deposit money back in

There are more efficient ways to do this. But we are doing this for learning.
